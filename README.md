# Windows 10 clone

Windows 10 clone is a web app built with React that tries to replicate core features, behavior and design of Windows 10 as closely as possible in the browser.

This project is my highschool final paper, and it was inspired by a [portfolio based on Linux](https://vivek9patel.github.io/)

```
C
└─ users
   └─ admin
      └─ Desktop
      └─ Documents
      └─ Downloads
      └─ Pictures
      └─ Videos
```

### Processes

- Apps can have multiple instances
- Apps can have child processes
- App instances can be opened and closed independently
- Each process has a focus level that determines it's z-index on the desktop
